# The Kivy Playground
In this project section, you can find a collection of Kivy examples. The examples are meant to be used as a playground for learning Kivy.

All these playground examples are taken from the [Kivy gallery](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gallery.html) and are meant to be run as-is. The examples are not modified in any way.

To run the examples, execute the following command in the root of the project:
```
poetry run python playground/<demo-code-folder>/main.py
```

For example, to run the [kivycatalog](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/gen__demo__kivycatalog__main__py.html) example, execute the following command:
```
poetry run python playground/kivycatalog/main.py
```

The kivy-catalog example is espescially useful, since you can test out all the widgets that Kivy has to offer.

The examples are taken from the [kivy github repository (demo folder)](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples/demo).
